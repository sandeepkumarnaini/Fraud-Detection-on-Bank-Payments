# ** PROBLEM STATEMENT ** 
 When the Bank receives a loan application, the Bank has to decide for the loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

## **  Suggestions from Analysis ** 
**** Previously cancelled clients have actually repayed the loan of 90%. Record the reason for cancellation which might help the bank to determine and negotiate terms with these repaying customers in future for increase business opportunity.

****88% of the clients who were refused by bank for loan earlier have now turned into a repaying client. Hence documenting the reason for rejection could mitigate the 
business loss and these clients could be contacted for further loans.
